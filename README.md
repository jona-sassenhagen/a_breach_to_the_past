# Dungeon Breach

[Dungeon Breach](static_assets/title.png)

This is a silly game I vibe coded together as an exploration of the idea: Zelda + Into the Breach.

- Collect treasure and stay alive
- Monsters telegraph movement and attacks
- Coax foes into breaking each other and furniture to expose more loot
- Good luck

See credits.txt for the awesome creators of the CCBA art used here. They deserve a much better game to be made out of it.
